Hi! I'm Kun Liu.

As a software engineer, I'm interested in <strong>computational geometry</strong>, <strong>data/geographic visualization</strong>, <strong>3d</strong>.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Geographic Information Science(GIS) from Nanjing Normal University.

I will publish some interesting examples.
